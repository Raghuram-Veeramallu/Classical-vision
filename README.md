## Classical Computer Vision Techniques

Implementation of Classical Computer Vision Techniques

| Technique | Description | Implemented in |
|-----------|-------------| ---------|
| [MNIST Digit Recognition](./mnist-digit-recognition/) | This projects aims at comparing the performance of Single Layer Perceptron vs. Multi-layer Perceptron vs. CNN in terms of identifying digits of the MNIST dataset | Python |
| [Scene Recognition](./scene-recognition/) | Using Tiny image, KNN, SVM and Bag of Visual Words to perform scene recognition. | Python |
| [Stereo Reconstruction](./stereo-reconstruction/) | A technique which computes the disparity between a pair of stereo images to perform 3D reconstruction of the scene. | Python, OpenCV |
| [Dolly Zoom](./dolly-zoom/) | A technique in which simultaneously zooming-in while moving the camera away from the subject to create a disorienting visual effect where the background seems to change size relative to the subject. | MATLAB |
| [Image Projection](./image_projection/) | A technique ccurately to map a logo onto the varying perspectives and surfaces in a video using Homography and Inverse Warping to ensure that logo maintains correct orientation and size relative to the camera view| MATLAB |
